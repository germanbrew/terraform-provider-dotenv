## Schema

### Optional

- `filename` (String) `Default: .env` Path to the dotenv file

### Read-Only

- `entries` (Map of String) Key-Value entries of the dotenv file. The values are by default considered nonsensitive. If you want to hide the values in any output as sensitive contents, you can use the [`sensitive()`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/sensitive) function.
